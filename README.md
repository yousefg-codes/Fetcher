# Fetcher

This project was a 3-application based business idea of creating a Doordash-like system but for small businesses that tend to be marginalized in the delivery-service industry. I began developing this in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years in high school but stopped in my senior year.

This was the basic tech stack:

- React Native for client-side (for the mobile apps)
- React for the website
- Firebase (and most of its sub-products including storage & firestore) for backend
- Stripe for payment handling

# Fetcher-Customers

In this app customers were able to:

- Sign Up/Sign in using Firebase Authentication
- Browse stores near them on the map in the home screen
- View nearby drivers on the map
- Browse recommended products on the home screen
- View products by categories in the search screen
- Search for products' names, and I used Dice's Coefficient to handle that
- Add/remove products to/from cart
- View item information
- View business information
- Browse items related to the current one they're viewing
- Rate an item out of 5 stars and write a review
- Place an order
- Track the driver's progress on their current order in the Orders screen
- View previously placed orders in the Orders screen
- Change/Edit personal information in the profile page including address & phone number
- Report issues with the application or issues with an order
- Read Privacy Policy, Terms of service
- View information about who made the App
- View basic help information in case they had any questions

# Fetcher-Drivers

Here's what drivers were able to do:

- Sign in/Sign Up, and the Sign Up process included quite a bit of information including bank information
- Begin a delivery session which removed distractions from the UI
- Accept/Decline orders
- View order information while driving
- Once within a half mile radius of the customer's address, a driver can complete the order
- View the route they have to take and follow it using the Google Maps API
- View their earnings in the home screen
- View past orders and all their information
- Updated Profile information
