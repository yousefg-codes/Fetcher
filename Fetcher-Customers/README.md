# Fetcher-Customers
This app was part of business idea of creating a Doordash-like system but for small businesses that tend to be marginalized in the delivery-service industry. I began developing this in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years in high school.

This was the basic tech stack:
 - React Native for client-side
 - Firebase (and most of its sub-products including storage & firestore) for backend
 - Stripe for payment handling

In this app customers were able to:
 - Sign Up/Sign in using Firebase Authentication
 - Browse stores near them on the map in the home screen
 - View nearby drivers on the map
 - Browse recommended products on the home screen
 - View products by categories in the search screen
 - Search for products' names, and I used Dice's Coefficient to handle that
 - Add/remove products to/from cart
 - View item information
 - View business information
 - Browse items related to the current one they're viewing
 - Rate an item out of 5 stars and write a review
 - Place an order
 - Track the driver's progress on their current order in the Orders screen
 - View previously placed orders in the Orders screen
 - Change/Edit personal information in the profile page including address & phone number
 - Report issues with the application or issues with an order
 - Read Privacy Policy, Terms of service
 - View information about who made the App
 - View basic help information in case they had any questions
